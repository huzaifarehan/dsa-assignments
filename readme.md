# Assignment Report

## Find Bribes
In this assignment, we used a sorting algorithm called **Insertion Sort** to sort an array of numbers. The main reason for choosing this algorithm was its simplicity and ease of understanding, especially for smaller arrays. We needed to calculate the total number of "bribes" required to sort the array in ascending order. By going through the array element by element and moving each element to its correct position in the sorted part of the array, we were able to count the total number of "bribes" needed to sort the array.

## Find Consecutive Overtime Working Days
For the second assignment, our task was to find the maximum number of consecutive days an employee worked overtime. To solve this problem, we used a straightforward method called **Linear Search**. This involved going through each day's working hours one by one until we found the days when the employee worked overtime. Although this method works fine for small lists, it may not be as efficient if the overtime days are located near the beginning or end of the list.

## Find Value 
In the third assignment, we had to search for a specific value in a sorted list. To achieve this, we opted for a technique known as **Binary Search**. The main reason for selecting this algorithm was its speed and efficiency, especially for larger lists. It's like dividing the list in half and checking if the value we're looking for is in the first half or the second half. By repeating this process, we could quickly find the value we wanted in the sorted array.

## Find Median
The final assignment required finding the "median" value of a list of numbers. To do this, we utilized **Insertion Sort** again (similar to Assignment 1) to sort the list. Once the list was sorted, we could easily find the "median" value by looking at the middle element (or the average of the two middle elements if the list had an even number of elements).
